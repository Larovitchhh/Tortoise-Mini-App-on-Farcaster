The Tortoise channel is moderated by its host and any invited co-hosts, who have the power to define norms, hide disruptive casts, or ban users who violate the channel’s standards. This isn’t censorship but a way to maintain the channel’s focus on deliberate discourse. If users disagree with the moderation, they can create their own channel with custom rules, reflecting Farcaster’s decentralized ethos. The channel’s creator pays a fee in warps (Farcaster’s in-client currency) to establish it, discouraging name-squatting and ensuring active use.
