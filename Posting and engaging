Anyone can post in the Tortoise channel by selecting it when creating a cast in the Farcaster client. The client automatically sets the cast’s parentUrl to https://farcaster.xyz/~/channel/tortoise, marking it as part of the channel’s feed. A cast is considered “in” the channel if it directly references the channel’s URL or replies to another cast within the channel. These casts are stored on Farcaster’s decentralized hubs, making them accessible for querying via a replicator (e.g., for developers pulling channel data).

Tortoise encourages posts that align with its norms, which are set by the host and may include guidelines for respectful, thoughtful dialogue. Users must agree to these norms to participate, ensuring the channel remains a space for constructive conversation. For example, you might cast about a philosophical question, a deep dive into decentralized tech, or a nuanced take on current events, sparking replies and discussions from other users.
